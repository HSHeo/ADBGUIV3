Current Release:
3.7.3SP1P Is the first Partial Service Pack (Partial meaning in testing phase to see what can and cannot be done to the application in a service pack)
Although service packs do not add functinality, I have changed the way the user sees the updates.

Enjoy!

Current Release:
3.7.3 Has the latest features we can think of! Of course we are still working on more just for you! 
What has been added in 3.7.3:
> Partial Service Pack Support (DLL/PLUGIN)
> Server Messages (Your reading now!)
> Support for language packs (Multi-Language like en,es,fr, etc)


Comming up in later updates:

Version 4 of ADBGUI will support "Service Packs" as well as in place upgrades.
All this allowing the program to be updated while it is in use.

Also coming in Version 4:
Ability to OTA Android device when available. Meaning ADBGUI will check if your device has an update waiting for it. (Note: This will only work for certain versions of android like Cyanogenmod.)
